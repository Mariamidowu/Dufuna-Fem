At the end of this program, I want to be able to perform globally as a full-stack software engineer.
I believe I would be equipped with the knowledge and apply it when and where needed.
I should be able to work in a team and carry out individual and group projects/tasks successfully.
Ultimately, getting a great job, starting a career and loving my job is the goal.
